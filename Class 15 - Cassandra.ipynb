    "Companies often choose Apache Cassandra over\n",
    "traditional SQL databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL)\n",
    "or NoSQL databases (like MongoDB) for specific use cases\n",
    "and scenarios where the requirements differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to use Cassandra is\n",
    "influenced by its unique characteristics, \n",
    "strengths, and limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scalability: \n",
    "\n",
    "Cassandra is designed for horizontal scalability,\n",
    "but not vertically.\n",
    "It can handle large amounts of data and high write\n",
    "and read loads by distributing data across\n",
    "multiple nodes in a cluster. \n",
    "This makes it suitable for applications\n",
    "with high throughput requirements and growing data volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical scalability, also known as scaling up\n",
    "or scaling vertically, involves adding more resources\n",
    "(e.g., CPU, RAM, storage) to an existing server\n",
    "or node within a system. \n",
    "This typically means upgrading the hardware\n",
    "of the existing machine by adding more powerful components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal scalability, also known as scaling out\n",
    "or scaling horizontally, involves adding more machines\n",
    "or nodes to a system to distribute the workload. \n",
    "Instead of making an individual machine more powerful,\n",
    "you add more machines to share the load.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High Availability: \n",
    "\n",
    "Cassandra provides built-in support for fault tolerance\n",
    "and high availability. \n",
    "Data is replicated across multiple nodes,\n",
    "and if one node fails,\n",
    "the system can continue to operate without data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distributed Architecture: \n",
    "\n",
    "Cassandra is a distributed database,\n",
    "making it suitable for global deployments\n",
    "and multi-data center setups. \n",
    "It can handle data distribution\n",
    "across multiple geographic locations,\n",
    "ensuring low-latency access.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. No Single Point of Failure: \n",
    "\n",
    "Cassandra is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. \n",
    "There is no single point of failure, \n",
    "which is crucial for mission-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Model: \n",
    "\n",
    "Cassandra uses a wide-column store data model. \n",
    "This makes it well-suited for time-series data, \n",
    "event logging, and other use cases where data\n",
    "with varying structures is collected and stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write-Heavy Workloads: \n",
    "\n",
    "Cassandra is optimized for write-heavy workloads \n",
    "and can efficiently handle time-series data, sensor data,\n",
    "and event logging, making it popular in industries \n",
    "such as finance, IoT, and social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Tunable Consistency: \n",
    "\n",
    "Cassandra allows you to configure the level of data consistency\n",
    "according to your application's needs. \n",
    "This flexibility is beneficial for use cases where\n",
    "some level of eventual consistency is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Linear Scalability: \n",
    "\n",
    "As you add more nodes to a Cassandra cluster, \n",
    "you can achieve linear scalability,\n",
    "meaning that performance scales almost proportionally\n",
    "with the number of nodes added.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that \n",
    "Cassandra might not be the best choice for all use cases. \n",
    "SQL databases and MongoDB have their strengths in different areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases: \n",
    "\n",
    "These are suitable for applications where structured data,\n",
    "complex transactions, and strong consistency requirements are essential.\n",
    "SQL databases are often used in traditional enterprise applications and reporting systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB: \n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database \n",
    "that is flexible with unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "It's suitable for applications where rapid development,\n",
    "flexible schema, and simple querying are necessary.\n",
    "MongoDB is often used in web and mobile applications.\n",
